# Fair Art Royalty Distribution System

## Project Title
Fair Art Royalty Distribution System

## Project Description
The **Fair Art Royalty Distribution System** is a smart contract-based platform that facilitates transparent, decentralized royalty distribution to artists and contributors involved in the creation of digital art. This contract ensures that whenever an artwork is sold or monetized, the agreed-upon royalty shares are automatically and fairly distributed to all the contributors (e.g., artists, collaborators, etc.) based on their pre-defined shares.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower digital artists and their collaborators by providing a secure and transparent platform where royalties are distributed automatically based on pre-agreed shares. This removes the possibility of human error or dishonesty, creating a fairer ecosystem for artists.

## Key Features
- **Royalty Distribution**: The system allows multiple recipients to receive royalties based on predefined shares whenever an artwork is sold or monetized.
- **Transparency**: All transactions are recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, providing transparency in the royalty distribution process.
- **Flexible Share Allocation**: The system supports customizable royalty shares for each artwork, which can be updated by the creator.
- **Secure**: The distribution is automated and secure, minimizing the potential for human error or disputes.

## Future Scope
- **NFT Integration**: This contract can be extended to work with NFT marketplaces, ensuring royalties are distributed automatically each time an NFT is resold.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a user-friendly web interface that allows artists and stakeholders to interact with the contract without needing to understand Solidity or blockchain.
- **Dynamic Royalty Changes**: Implement features where the royalty share percentages can change dynamically based on certain conditions like artwork popularity or market conditions.
- **Cross-Blockchain Compatibility**: Extend the system to support multiple blockchains, making it accessible to more users across different platforms.
- **Improved Governance**: Implement governance mechanisms allowing stakeholders to vote on changes to the royalty distribution system.
